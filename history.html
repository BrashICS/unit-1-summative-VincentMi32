        John V. atansoff and Clifford Berry started working on their computer in 1937 and it was finshed in 1942 and it was called the ABC and it was the first computer that worked in binary.Rather than the base 10, it also took a long time to figure out an eqaution but know you can get it in a matter of seconds even milliseconds. But we don't really care about the current computers right now, but at the time it was done in 1942 Clifford Berry made his own raido with scraps he found in his dad's garage other than the wires and channels. There was a replca of this computer that was built in 1997.

        John V. atansoff made the first computer for bulgains which was finshed about a year after he made the computer with Clifford Berry and after this a lot of computers started to run using binary instead of the base 10 like a lot of other things did at the time.
