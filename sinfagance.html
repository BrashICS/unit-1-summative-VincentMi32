    <p>The signifgance of Clifford Berry and John V. Atanasoff ivention it was a computer that could help you solve linear eqaution but it could do 29 eqautions at once but the only problem it took a little while to actually finsh 1 but it marked a turning point for computers because unlike other computers at the time used the base 10 system, but this one didn't it instead used the binary system.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So what the binary system is it's system that uses one's and zero's but the base ten goes 1 to 9 at the time people thought this computer wouldn't work at first but once they actually tried it, they changed their mind because after this invetion a lot of other computers after this started to use binary to actaully run all the question, eqautions or any problems you had with anything</p>
